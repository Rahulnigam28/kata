# Use a centralized notification for external communication

Date: 10/27

## Status

accepted 

## Context

Different from an internal event queue or event bus, this is a subdomain responsible for external communication. 

## Decision

We decided to have a dedicated notification system responsible of sending and receiving external notification. The reasons is:
+ Customer, Order, Inventory subdomain all require communication to external users, such as customer, chef and delivery. It makes sense to have a shared service instead of each subdomain use their own. 

## Consequences

Centralized notification system will be tightly coupled to the publishers.
