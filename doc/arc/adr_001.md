# TITLE Use Actor/Action approach to discover components

Date: 10/23

## Status

accepted

## Context

At the beginning of the design, we compared event storming, actor/action, and workflow approach, to determine which one to use for discovering component.

## Decision

We decided actor/action approach is the most suitable, because the system is not complex enough, and because the system is not a workflow based system. Event storming and actor/action approach would probably yield the same discovered component. We choose actor/action approach.

## Consequences

The architecture diagram will not reflect workflow directly.
