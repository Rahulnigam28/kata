# [ADR_012](../../README.md) Use mobile friendly web application

Date: 10/29

## Status

accepted

## Context

We discussed the form of front end choices for the initial design. We were debating over native app vs mobile friendly web app.

### Option 1: **Native app**
#### Pros
+ Smooth user experience
+ Capable location based service based on GPS information
+ Push notification 

#### Cons
+ Have to support multiple platforms to support, longer developing time and high cost
+ Higher maintenance  cost and update cost

### Option 2: **Mobile friendly app**
#### Pros
+ Low cost to develop, and easy to maintain, available for all users. 
+ No update on user side required

#### Cons
+ No precise location information
+ No push notification


## Decision
We have chosen mobile friendly web app, mostly because of cost efficiency and faster deployment, which are crucial in the initial stage. Farmacy Food can always develop native app later if needed.

## Consequences
Web app does not have reliable location based information.
