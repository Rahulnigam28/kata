# Put Delivery component into Inventory subdomain

Date: 10/23

## Status

accepted 

## Context

Initial component discovery contains generic subdomains such as: Order, Billing and Shipping & Delivery. 

## Decision

Merge Shipping and delivery subdomain into Inventory subdomain. Reasons:
+ The business model of Farmacy Food does not use a traditional shipping and delivery model. The delivery actually means re-stocking to the SmartFridge, which is part of the inventory management subdomain.
+ Inventory is a core subdomain of the system, how to restock is an essential part it.

## Consequences
