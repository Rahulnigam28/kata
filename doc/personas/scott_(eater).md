# Scott

Scott is an occasional Farmacy Food eater, but not a member. His apartment building has a Farmacy Food SmartFridge, so when he doesn't feel like cooking, he checks online or looks or goes downstairs to check and see if there anything that strikes his fancy. If there is he either purchses it on his phone or simply uses his credit card at the SmartFridge to make his purchase.
