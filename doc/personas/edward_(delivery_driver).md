# [Edward](../../README.md)

Edward is a Farmacy Food delivery person. Every morning he goes to the central kitchen, checks the inventory and requirements of the stops on his route, loads his truck and heads out.

At each location he refills the kiosk/SmartFridge with items that have shown to be popular there and meals for any subscribers that have designated his stop as a pickup point. He also removes any food from the kiosk/SmartFridge that is past it's expiration date. At each location Edward verifies that the correct inventory, including everything he has added and removed, is recorded for the location.
