# [Jennifer](../../README.md)

Jennifer is a Farmacy Food subscriber, she likes to eat healthy.

Jennifer subscribes to salad lunch every Monday and Wednesday and Friday. Jennifer goes to the coffee shop near her office at noon on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to pick up her lunch, which was delivered fresh that morning.

Jennifer generally manages her subscription online, handling vacations and time off that way, but when the team decides to go out for lunch on a day that she has a lunch scheduled she uses her phone to quickly shift it to the next day.
